## Features

### üîç **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Distribution Analysis**: Histograms and box plots to analyze feature distributions and outliers.
- **Multi-variable Analysis**: Pair plots, scatter plots, and relationship matrices for deeper insights into the data.

### üìà **Correlation Analysis**
- Generate a detailed correlation matrix heatmap.
- Supports both 2D and 3D visualization for feature relationships.

### ü§ñ **Machine Learning Model**
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Predicts the risk of hypertension based on health metrics.
- **Feature Importance**: Visualizes the most influential features in predicting hypertension.
- **Interactive Prediction**: Users can input their own data to get hypertension risk predictions.

### üñ•Ô∏è **Interactive Dashboard**
- Built using **Streamlit**, with an intuitive multi-page navigation system.
- Custom styling and animations enhance the user experience.
